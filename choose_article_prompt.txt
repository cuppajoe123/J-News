Read these headlines and choose the one that would give the most interesting, inspiring, absurd, or insightful stories. Your maximum limit is 3 headlines, but you do not need to reach three if there are not three good headlines. If there are no worthy headlines, return nothing. Be very selective with headlines, less is more. Output just the names of the articles, if any, without any line numbering, bullet points, dashes or quotes. Just one article name per line.
