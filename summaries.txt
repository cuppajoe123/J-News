A recent study from researchers at the University of Montpellier, the University of Zurich, and other institutions has made an important connection between domestic dog breeds and their brain structure. The study, published in *Biology Letters*, reveals that the relative endocranial volume (REV)—essentially, a measure of brain size relative to body size—correlates significantly with breed functions, behaviors, and even phylogenetic classification among dogs. The researchers analyzed data from 1,682 dogs representing 172 breeds, discovering that factors such as breed function and cranial shape influence brain morphology. Interestingly, while domestic dogs have smaller brains compared to their wild ancestors, the gray wolf, they still display a range of cognitive abilities that challenge traditional views linking brain size directly to intelligence. For instance, toy breeds, developed primarily as companions, were found to have larger relative brain sizes for their body mass, while working breeds, trained for complex tasks like guarding or rescue, showed smaller brain sizes. This intriguing finding suggests that the complexity of a dog's skills doesn’t necessarily dictate brain size, as traits like aggression and fear were also positively correlated with REV, whereas trainability was negatively correlated. This research is significant as it illustrates how domestication and selective breeding have affected not just physical traits but also the cognitive abilities and behaviors of dogs. Understanding these correlations can help improve dog breeding practices and enhance our overall comprehension of canine behavior and welfare.
This article discusses an important breakthrough in cancer research involving selenoproteins, particularly focusing on the enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). While selenoproteins play essential roles in various biological processes, GPX4 can inadvertently protect cancer cells, making them harder to kill with traditional therapies. Researchers from the University of Würzburg and the Heidelberg Institute for Stem Cell Technology have discovered new pathways related to selenoprotein production and have identified another enzyme, peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6), which can facilitate this process. The significance of this work lies in the potential to inhibit GPX4, which could lead to more effective treatments for various cancers, notably neuroblastoma—an aggressive cancer that mainly affects young children. By revealing how PRDX6 interacts with selenium and maintains the survival of cancer cells, the team is proposing new therapeutic targets. The collaborative nature of this research, involving institutions from Germany, Brazil, and advancements in techniques like mass spectrometry and CRISPR-Cas9, emphasizes its innovative approach and potential impact on future cancer treatments. In summary, this study opens up new strategies for combating tough childhood cancers by targeting overlooked aspects of selenoprotein metabolism.
A recent study from UC Davis reveals how mountain lions in greater Los Angeles have adapted their behavior to coexist with the area's numerous outdoor recreational activities. Researchers found that these big cats are shifting their activity patterns primarily to nocturnal hours in response to increased human presence, particularly in regions like Griffith Park, which records high recreation levels. The study, which monitored 22 mountain lions over several years using GPS and accelerometer collars, highlights that female mountain lions tend to be more active during daylight to avoid male lions, while males show a strong tendency to be nocturnal when facing heavier human traffic. This adjustment is critical for their survival in such an urban environment, demonstrating a remarkable flexibility in their routine that facilitates coexistence with humans. This research is significant because it underscores the potential for harmony between urban communities and wildlife, emphasizing that mountain lions are making conscious efforts to adapt rather than becoming habituated to human activities. As outdoor recreation grows in popularity, it's essential for people to be aware of and considerate toward mountain lion activity, especially at dawn and dusk. The study's lead author, Ellie Bolas, and others hope these findings inspire more awareness and proactive measures to protect both wildlife and human interests amidst the challenges posed by urbanization.
